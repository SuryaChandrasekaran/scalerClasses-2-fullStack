Immutability: Props are immutable, meaning that they cannot be changed from within the component that receives them. In the counter example, we need to be able to modify the count value when the user clicks the increment or decrement buttons. Since props cannot be modified, they are not suitable for managing the state in this scenario.

Single Source of Truth: In React, it's a best practice to have a single source of truth for your data. By using state, you ensure that the component itself is the authority on its state, rather than relying on external data (props) that could change unpredictably.

Re-rendering: When the state of a component changes, React automatically re-renders the component to reflect the updated state. This is essential for maintaining a responsive user interface. Props, on the other hand, are static and do not trigger re-renders when they change. If we were to use props to manage the count in our example, we would have to manually trigger re-renders, which goes against React's declarative programming model.
